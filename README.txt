# Cipher
A very basic (and not secure) cryptographic cipher I built to take my first step into this field.

list of commands:
in:
in.encrypt
in.decrypt
in.print
out.print
rand.print
rand.print,
rand.give,
mult.edit:
seed.edit:
incr.edit:
modu.edit:
configs
configs.restore
exit

This cipher uses what is called the Linear Congruential Algorithm. It is notoriously not a cryptographically secure algorithm, but it was the one I was the most curious in.

To encode a message simply type "in:" followed by a message. To encrypt that message type in "in.encrypt" To print out the encryption, type in out.print.

The same process can be done in reverse with the decrypt function.

By typing in configs, you will be taken to the four parameters required to run the algorithm. The multiplier, the seed, the increment, and the modulus.
You can edit any one of these or reset the configs to default. (I created the default settings by keyboard mashing)

Here's a code I memorized:
